# Real-time Games

 An adjacent area to fNIRS sensing is HEG or Hemoencephalography, which provides frontal lobe measurement of changes in blood flow. There are few companies exploring brain sensing devices with this including [HEGduino](https://www.hegalpha.com/) and [Mendi](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mendi/mendi-natural-brain-training-anytime-anywhere-anyone)

 The main pretence here is training your brain to control the amount of oxygen flowing in and out of the frontal lobe region to help build the mind as a muscle. Simple visual and interactive games have been shown to cause a positive effect here when conducted 2-3 times per week. Think of it like going to gym and conducting exercises for your mind.

 The challenge here is making engaging enough games that are fun, simple and intuitive to play. For example a simple circle that grows and expands relative to your oxygen level can be used for this. Below shows how this could be done with a concept of making bubbles pop.

 We are excited to see what type of postive impact we can create here through an appless experience, more to come soon!
