# Finding Your Tempo

A concept we have been exploring recently has been how to find your own tempo, mental rhythm and how does this relate to how we feel each day.

For example on certain days we might have a need to rush more while on others we need to drag or slow ourselves down. For each day this would result in a different tempo of rhythm. 

Learning how to manage and stay in this rhythm is difficult and only with the right tools and insight can we potentially achieve this. 

To start we need to be come aware of ourselves when we are either dragging, rushing or are in a moderate tempo between the two. 

Using time as the period to which we remain in each mindset we can learn to understand when we rush, drag and stay in tempo.
