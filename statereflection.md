# State of Mind Reflection

A concept we have started to explore is how our state of mind can be reflected by a colour shown. Does our state of mind that lock-in to that colour when we are shown it later?

We noticed an interesting behaviour where we flashed out light red-white-red-white at a point where the software thought it might be a good time to take a break. This flashing in-fact caused more annoyance than positive behavioural response. 

To adjust this we are exploring software color transitions or more calming color switching to provide an indication to the wearer. 

For example a slow transition from blue to light blue and back again.
