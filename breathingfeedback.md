# Deep Breathing Feedback

 One exercise that can help regulate stress during the day is the habit of taking deep breathes. 

 Here is a published research articale on the effects of deep breathing, [reduction of oxidative stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139518/). 

 [In this study](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2017/03/study-discovers-how-slow-breathing-induces-tranquility.html) from Stanford Medicine the indepth exploration of how breathing affects different states of mind is explored.

 As part of a simple feedback loop; we have started to test the affect of conscious breathing with a single colour feedback loop; as you take deeper and more consistent breathes the colour changes. Our current concept is to see how many times a day a person can get the LED to change colour and what amount if we set two levels.
