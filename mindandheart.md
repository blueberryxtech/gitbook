# Comparing the Mind and Heart

We did a simple experiment recently where we tracked our heart and mind using a [whoop fitness band](https://www.whoop.com/) and the Blueberry eyeglasses. The purpose being to start to derive insight as to how the heart and mind work together over a longer period of time.

For this period over 3 hours; 4 activities occurred: jogging, working, biking and rest

The interesting insight from this appears to an overall drop in oxygenation change while jogging followed by a period of steady peaks and higher brain oxygenation during the time after the first exercise.

An area we are aiming to get to is to be able to use this type of information to be able to suggest a point in your day where you should do an activity such as walking, biking or jogging to reset your mind.
