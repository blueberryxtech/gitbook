# Finding Your Breathing Tempo

This past week we started to explore how the blinking of an etint lense paired with mental load and heart rate can be used as a guiding step for a person to adjust their breathing rate.

The feedback mechanism for taking a deep breathe and breathing out was tinting the glasses on and off in a step function. The initial experiment was as follows:

1. Wearer ran for 30 seconds to increase their heart rate
2. Wearer then either followed the tinting feedback for when to breathe or at their own pace

We found that it took on average 60 seconds to return to a stable heart rate with both the guided and at own pace feedback loops. To futher our experiment we looked at deep breathing techniques from the [U.S. Military Navy Seals](https://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nmcphc/Documents/health-promotion-wellness/psychological-emotional-wellbeing/Combat-Tactical-Breathing.pdf); whereby the guided method is:

1. 4 seconds inhale 
2. 4 seconds hold
3. 4 seconds exhale 
4. 4 seconds hold

... repeat ...
