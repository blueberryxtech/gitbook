# Finding Your Breathing Tempo

This past week we started to explore how the blinking of an etint lense paired with mental load and heart rate can be used as a guiding feedback for a person to adjust their breathing rate.

The feedback mechanism for taking a deep breathe and breathing out was tinting the glasses on and off in a step function. The initial experiment was as follows:

1. Wearer ran for 30 seconds to increase their heart rate
2. Wearer then either followed the tinting feedback for when to breathe or at their own pace

We found that it took on average 60 seconds to return to a stable heart rate with both the guided and at own pace feedback loops. To futher our experiment we looked at deep breathing techniques from the [U.S. Military Navy Seals](https://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nmcphc/Documents/health-promotion-wellness/psychological-emotional-wellbeing/Combat-Tactical-Breathing.pdf); whereby the guided method is:

1. 4 seconds inhale 
2. 4 seconds hold
3. 4 seconds exhale 
4. 4 seconds hold

... repeat ...

Preliminary notes are:
- 5-10 bpm drop in heart rate post performing the 4 second timed breathing technique
- Anecdotal feedback of "it made me feel better"


The next area we explored was to determine what happens to our brain activity oxygenation during the task being presented to a person for the first time. The result was interesting! We found that for a person the first time they try the box breathing method the amount of oxygen increased during the period of guided breathing and a minimized change in oxygen from before and after the technique.

To guide the individual we presented the breathing timing on a laptop computer screen in a dark room.

On the three people we tested this on the result was consistent. On average there was a 4% result change in before and after the box breathing technique; where as there was a 11% change when breathing normally without any guided presentation on how to breathe.

The regional brain activity increased during the period of timed breathing. Our next test will be to see what the affect is if presented the guided technique without an high attention guidance presented on a computer screen.
